A tool to perform bulk analysis of Racelogic VBOX files

## Usage
Download the zip file in the latest release and unzip into a folder. 

Run vboxanalyser.exe. This should open up a browser window. If not, open a browser and got to `http://localhost:8080`. Using the file directory tree, use the chevrons to expand the directories. Then click on the directory name to analyse that directory and all subfolders.

## Note
This is very much work in progress. Use at your own risk.
